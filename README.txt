'A New Approach For Learning Interpretable Classification Models' Research Project

The Python3 Language was used for this project. It can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/
The files are accessible through a JupyterNotebook. It can be downloaded from https://jupyter.org/install

Numpy, pandas and sklearn libraries were used for this project.
The is_numeric_dtype module is used from pandas to encode nominal attribute values
The preprocessing, KFold, StratifiedKFold, cross_val_score, metrics, DecisionTreeClassifier, GaussianNB, KNeighborsClassifier along with other modules were used from sklearn for preprocessing and classification processes.

bmi.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/bmidataset), diabetes.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), glass.csv (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification) and wineqt.csv (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset) databases were modified and used for this project.
